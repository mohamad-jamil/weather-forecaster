# Weather Pattern Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts future weather patterns based on historical data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the code, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Requests

You can install these dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn requests```

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/mohamad-jamil/weather-forecaster.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd weather-forecaster```

3. Create a dotenv file with your API credentials from OpenWeatherMap. You can obtain an API key by signing up for an account on their website.

4. Run the code using the following command:
```python src/main.py```
